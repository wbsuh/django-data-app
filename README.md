Django serving a d3.js bar chart 

This django app serves a simple d3.js bar chart using Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)'s Arms Transfer Database.

The dataset covers suppliers and sum of arm transfers to Indo-Pacific states (excluding Oceania) between 1946-2016. This dataset was parsed for my MA dissertation.
